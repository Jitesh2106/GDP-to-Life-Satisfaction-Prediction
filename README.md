# GDP-to-Life-Satisfaction-Prediction

## Overview:
This project employs a Linear Regression model and a KNN regressor model to predict the life satisfaction of a country given its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

## Tools and Libraries:
The project leverages the following key technologies:

### Numpy for efficient numerical operations
### Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
### Matplotlib for data visualization
### Scikit-Learn (sklearn) for machine learning tasks, particularly for implementing the Linear Regression model
